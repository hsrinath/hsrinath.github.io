<p>I am a second year undergraduate student at Cornell University, majoring in Biological Sciences and concentrating in Molecular and Cell Biology. I study cell size patterning in the sepal of the Arabidopsis Thaliana in the Roeder Lab in the Weill Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology. I am a study group leader for the class BioMG 1350 Intro to Cell and Developmental Biology through the Biology Scholars Program, a selective program aimed at helping underrepresented minoritites pursue higher education in Biology. I am Vice President of Fundraising Outreach for the global health organization Unite for Sight, which fundraises for sight-restoring cataract surgeries for people living in poverty and without access to medical care in India, Ghana, and Honduras. 

<p></p>Extracurriculars
<p>Unite For SightÂ® is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that empowers communities worldwide to improve eye health and eliminate preventable blindness. Through monthly fundraising efforts, the Cornell chapter of this organization raises money to fund cataract surgeries for people who are unable to afford or have access to sight-restoring surgeries. Unite for Sight has clinics located in Ghana, India, and Honduras. For every fifty dollars raised, one person's sight can be restored. 100% of the fundraiser money goes towards these surgeries because the organization gets funding for its activities separately. 
As Social Chair for the Cornell chapter, organized social events whose purpose was to foster friendships between volunteers and officers. Worked with the other officers to help plan, prepare, publicize, and staff our monthly fundraising events.
